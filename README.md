# 📚 React-Redux Bookstore

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/).

Iterating on the previous topics covered in React and most recently Redux, this project sets out with the objective of creating a simple bookstore using React and Redux.

## 🧮 The Project Brief

The premise of this project follows that Magic-Books Inc (a fictional company), has requested our help in creating a front-end application to help them organise and manage their bookstore. We will obtain the objective by building a fast, dynamic and responsive web app using React and Redux.

## 🧬 Technologies & Languages Used

- Node.js
- React
- Redux
- NPM
- SCSS
- Javascript (ES6)

## 🔰 Setup & Usage

### Setup
As this is the first milestone of the project, there is little you can do with this project. That being said, if you wish to run the project locally on your machine and see what the app holds so far, complete the following steps:
  1. (Download this repository directly,)[https://github.com/Psiale/react-redux-bookstore/archive/feature/first-milestone.zip] or (clone)[https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository] this repository using the green 'Code' button at the top of this page.
  2. Once you have this repository downloaded,  (`cd`)[https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/] into the root of the downloaded repository via your terminal.
  3. Time to install all the relevant dependencies in order to get the project to run correctly. Enter the following command into your terminal once you are safely sat at the repositories root:
    `npm install`
  This will install all dependencies and should complete without error.
  4. Finally, in order to run the project, punch in the following command to your terminal:
    `npm start`
  This will compile and open the project in your browser of choice. Thats it!
